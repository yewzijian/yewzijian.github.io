## About me
I am a Computer Science PhD student at the National University of Singapore, working in Gim Hee Lee's group.  Previously, I obtained my Bachelors of Engineering (Computer Engineering) from National University of Singapore in 2011. After graduating, I worked several years in DSO National Laboratories, which is Singapore's Defence R&D organization. During that time I also obtained a Computer Science Masters from Georgia Institute of Technology under their [OMSCS] program.  My research interest is in Computer Vision, particularly in the area of Deep Learning and Point Cloud processing. To keep my sanity, my personal interests include consumer technology, photography, and anime.
