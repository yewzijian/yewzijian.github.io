I'm a first year Computer Science PhD student at the National University of Singapore. My research interests are in Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, and Robotics. Personally, I also have interests in consumer electronics and IoT.

Before this, I had worked several years at DSO National Laboratories. It's a hard decision to make, going back to school after all these years, becoming one of the oldest PhD students in the school. Keeping my fingers crossed that this is the right decision to make.

I created this blog to document my long journey as a PhD student. This is not the first time I tried blogging, but I gave up after a while each time. Let's see how long it'll last this time ;)
