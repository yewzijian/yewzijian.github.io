<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am a Computer Science PhD student at the National University of Singapore, working under the supervision of Gim Hee Lee.  Previously, I obtained my Bachelors of Engineering (Computer Engineering) from National University of Singapore in 2011. After graduating, I worked several years in DSO National Laboratories, which is Singapore's Defence R&D organization. During that time I also obtained a Computer Science Masters from Georgia Institute of Technology under their <a href="http://www.omscs.gatech.edu">OMSCS</a> program.  My research interest is in Computer Vision, particularly in the area of Deep Learning and Point Cloud processing. To keep my sanity, my personal interests include consumer technology and <a href="photography.html">photography</a>. </p>
