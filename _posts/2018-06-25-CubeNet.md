Typical convolutional networks are translational (but not rotationally) equivariant, but rotational equivariance is still important since objects are invariant to object poses. CubeNet proposes a 3D Group Convolutional Neural Network with linear equivariance to translations and _right angle_ rotations in three dimensions.

That said, I do not quite understand some details in the paper, particularly in equation (11):

$$[F*W]_{tr} = \sum_{\tau \in \Z^3} \sum_{\rho \in V} [tr W]_{\tau \rho} F_{\tau \rho} = \sum_{\tau \in \Z^3} \sum_{\rho \in V} [t[rW]_\rho]_{\tau} F_{\tau \rho} $$

This should mean that the output has size $$H \times W \times D \times \text{num_rotations}$$. But Fig. 4 seems to just imply that it's just $$H \times W \times D$$. Is this because of the global average pooling (briefly stated in the ModelNet10 section)? Is the average pooling only in the rotational dimension? This is not clear to me. Also, if that is true, doesn't the rotational equivariance become invariance?
