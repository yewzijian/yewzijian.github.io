The [official docs](https://dochub.comp.nus.edu.sg/cf/guides/printing/start) (require login) from NUS SoC only provides instructions on setting up the network printer on Windows or Mac. The steps to set up the printer in Ubuntu isn't that complicated, but is not too obvious either, so here's the guide on how to set up the printer in Ubuntu 16.04 (the interface is slightly different for Ubuntu 18, but the general steps are the same).

### Installing Network Printer

1. First, take note of the name (e.g. psxxxx) and brand/model (e.g. Lexmark MS810DN) of the printer. The name can be typically found on a green tag affixed on the printer.
2. Open the Printers menu. You can do this by pressing the [Super](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/keyboard-key-super.html.en) key, then typing "printers". Click the "Add" button on the top left of the window.
3. On the left, expand "Network Printer", and select "Windows Printer via SAMBA".
4. Type in the address of the printer under the text box "smb://" in the form:â€‹ `[domain]/[server]/[printer]`. For students, this should be: `nusstu/nts27/psaxxx` (replace `psaxxx` by the printer name accordingly). If you're a staff, the domain should be `nusstf` and the server *might* be `nts09`.
5. Under Authentication, select "Set authentication details now". Enter your NUSNET username and password (_without_ the domain). There's no need to press the "verify" button since it'll fail (but don't worry it'll still work).

6. Press the "Forward" button. If this is the first time you are installing a SAMBA printer, you might have to install certain packages, just do so. On the following two screens, select the brand of the printer (probably Lexmark), and the model accordingly. Accept the default options for the rest of the screens.
7. You're done. You can print a test page to ensure if the settings are correct.

### Removing Irrelevant Printers

You might see other network printers you do not recognize in your Printers window. This is due to Ubuntu automatically detecting and adding network printers in other labs. When you try to remove them, they'll just reappear almost instantly.

These actually do not cause any issues, but if you find them annoying like me, you can disable automatic network printer installation using the following two commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop cups-browsed
sudo systemctl disable cups-browsed
```

Then remove the unwanted printers and they should no longer reappear.
