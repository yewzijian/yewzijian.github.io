<p> I like photography, though I'm not a serious photographer by any measure. And I must admit I haven't been taking much photos lately  (due to time or maybe it's my laziness). I typically use my iPhone 7<sup>1</sup>. But at times I do use a more "proper" camera, which is an Olympus E-P3 typically with a Panasonic 12-35mm f/2.8 lens.  This gallery here contains my favourite photos, organized roughly by their location.</p>
